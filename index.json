Consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning, and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of Earth over geologic time. Here we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations, supported by synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy to study the molecular-scale interfacial processes that influence surface complexation in ferrihydrite-water systems contain- ing aqueous MoO42−. We validate the utility of this approach by calculating surface complexation models directly from simulations. The reactive force-field captures the realistic dynamics of surface restructuring, surface charge equilibration, and the evolution of the interfacial water hydrogen bond network in response to adsorption and pro- ton transfer. We find that upon hydration and adsorption, ferrihydrite restructures into a more disordered phase through surface charge equilibration, as revealed by simulations and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. We observed how this restructuring leads to a different interfacial hydrogen bond network compared to bulk water by monitoring water dynamics. Using umbrella sampling, we constructed the free energy landscape of aqueous MoO42− adsorp- tion at various concentrations and the deprotonation of the ferrihydrite surface. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with the values reported by experimental surface complexation models. These findings are important as reactive molecular dynamics opens new avenues to study mineral-water interfaces, enriching and refining surface complexation models beyond their foundational assumptions.","tags":null,"title":"Probing atomic-scale processes at the ferrihydrite-water interface with reactive molecular dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Learn Molecular Simulations with Python is designed as a step-by-step guide to developing simple Python code that includes the basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) represent a special class with rigid ring-shaped molecules forming interconnected voids of 0.2 to 2 nanometers. PIMs have high specific surface areas and are scalable, making them ideal for gas adsorption and mixture separation. However, only a few fluid mixtures can currently be separated using nanoporous materials, with most methods still relying on costly thermal processes such as distillation. Developing new nanopore-based separation processes could address environmental issues such as water contamination and CO2 emissions. To facilitate the emergence of these new processes, a better understanding of the complex behaviors of nanoconfined fluid mixtures is crucial. Achieving this goal requires novel multiscale approaches to connect the molecular details of confined molecules at the nanoscale to macroscopic transport properties. The aim of this postdoctoral position is to correlate the molecular properties of fluid mixtures in a microporous polymer with its large-scale permeability and selectivity.\nActivities\nDevelopment of realistic models of mixtures in microporous polymers using molecular simulations. Characterization of the structural and dynamic properties of confined fluids and their interactions with polymer surfaces.

The offer has now expired, and the selection process has moved to the next step.\nScope. With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate.

All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited to time and length-scales that hinder modeling of systems like long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse-graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of loosing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1 while performing systematic measurements on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations, but with a systematic offset. This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intra-monomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers. We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details for the CG trajectories.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the validity of NMR relaxation rates obtained from coarse-grained simulations of PEG-water mixtures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ángel Díaz Carral","Xiang Xu","**Simon Gravelle**","Azade Yazdan Yar","Siegfried Schmauder","Maria Fyta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686700800,"objectID":"f7c6b3c3701b473915b1a423752df30a","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2023-stability-of-binary.html","publishdate":"2023-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-stability-of-binary.html","section":"publication","summary":"Binary complexes that can be found in copper alloys are investigated in this work through a combination of computer simulations and machine learning. Copper alloys are made of a copper matrix and a combination of single alloying elements in n-ary forms.  Due to the coexistence of different types of phases in this matrix, complex regions exist for which information on their precise atomistic structure is missing. In order to uncover such information, we apply active learning  and generate moment tensor potentials. This development is based on quantum-mechanical calculations. This approach allows the on-the-fly relaxation of many thousands of potentially novel candidates and check their stability. The ground-state energy of these structures is used to build active learning-generated convex hulls, which are in turn being compared to those from the simulations and the AFLOW database. This procedure provides an insight to additional new stable copper alloy relevant binary complexes. Here, in view of  Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, the  binary complexes Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Si, Cr-Ni, Cu-Ni, and Cu-Cr have been investigated. Their stability and the identification of novel stable candidates are discussed based on energetic arguments and the analysis of the respective phonon dispersion. The pipeline followed in this work is able to successfully predict binary phases in Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, specifically for the Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Ni and Cu-Ni complexes, and to extend the already reported structures in the AFLOW library. In the end, we show the applicability of a predicted Cu-Si stable phase and the developed machine learned potentials at the larger scale of atomistic simulations for the calculation of their mechanical properties and melting behavior.

Here, we use nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements to better understand the dynamic properties of water within two types of salt crusts: sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4 ). Our experimental results display a stronger dispersion of the relaxation time T1 with frequency for the case of Na2SO4 as compared to NaCl salt crusts. To gain insight into these results, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of salt solutions confined within slit nanopores made of either NaCl or Na2SO4 . We find a strong dependence of the value of the relaxation time T1 on pore size and salt concentration. Our simulations reveal the complex interplay between the adsorption of ions at the solid surface, the structure of water near the interface, and the dispersion of T1 at low frequency, which we attribute to adsorption-desorption events.","tags":null,"title":"NMR Investigation of Water in Salt Crusts: Insights from Experiments and Molecular Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The version 2.0 of LAMMPS tutorial has just been published, and offers:\na new structure with a sphinx template tutorials are now written in rst format, instead of html, which should facilitate future collaborations a gorgeous dark mode (for the tutorials, not yet for the index page) The version 1.0 is still visible here, but is not maintained and some commands are likely to be obsolete.\n","date":1675555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675555200,"objectID":"ee15b0519ba5c1c945f26268fe2520de","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/news/2023-lammpstutorial-v2.0.html","publishdate":"2023-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-lammpstutorial-v2.0.html","section":"news","summary":"Now with a new structure and a dark mode!","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"The version 2.0 of LAMMPS tutorials has been released","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After 2 great years at the ICP in Stuttgart, I am starting my own MSCA project (NanoSep) at LIPhy (UGA) in Benoit Coasne group.\n","date":1675123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675123200,"objectID":"66dd1b146c89edb888469dc3743a0900","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/news/2023-liphy-arrival.html","publishdate":"2023-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-liphy-arrival.html","section":"news","summary":"My goal is to evaluate the possibility of separating fluid mixtures using nanopores.","tags":["Personal"],"title":"New MSCA project NanoSep starting at UGA","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The version 0.7 of MAICoS has been released.

The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.","tags":null,"title":"Transport of thin water films: from thermally activated random walks to hydrodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adyant Agrawal","**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"d0401451a881c79dfebceae8fe530191","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2022-viscous-peeling.html","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-viscous-peeling.html","section":"publication","summary":"Combining molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum simulations, we study the dynamics of propagation of a peeling front in a system composed of multilayered graphene nanosheets completely immersed in water.

Using MD, we compute the pulling force as a function of the pulling velocity, and quantify the viscous resistance to the advancement of the peeling front. We compare the MD results to a 1D continuum model of a sheet loaded with modelled hydrodynamic loads. Our results show that the viscous dependence of the force on the velocity is negligible below a threshold velocity. Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance.

Our results also show that the surface activity of the particle depends on the number of surface oxygen groups as well as on their distribution: for a given number of oxygen groups, a GO particle with a patched surface was found to be more surface active than a particle with evenly distributed groups. Then, to understand what sets the thickness of GO layers at interfaces, the adsorption energy of a test GO particle was measured in the presence of multiple GO particles already adsorbed at the interface. Our results indicate that in the case of high degree of oxidation, particle–particle interactions at the water–vapor interface hinder the adsorption of the test particle.

But actual thin particles such as single-layer graphene are flexible and prone to bending deformations when exposed to shear stress. To study the effect of bending deformation on the dynamics of flexible platelike particles with large interfacial slip in a shear flow, we develop a two-dimensional (2D) fluid-structure interaction model. Our model is based on coupling the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with a boundary integral method to solve the hydrodynamic stress at the particle surface.

In this article, by solving the Fokker–Plank equation for the orientation distribution function and corroborating the analysis with boundary integral simulations, we quantify a threshold Péclet number, Pec, above which such alignment occurs. We found that for Pe smaller than Pec, but larger than a second threshold, a regime emerges where Brownian fluctuations are strong enough to break the platelet's alignment and induce rotations, but with a period of rotation that depends on the value of λ. For Pe below this second threshold, slip has a negligible effect on the orientational dynamics. We use these thresholds to classify the dynamics of graphene-like nanoplatelets for realistic values of λ and apply our results to the quantification of the orientational contribution to the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of nanoplatelets with slip.

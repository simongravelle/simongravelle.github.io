I primarily use molecular simulation, and my background, which combines simulations and experiments, facilitates my collaborations with experimentalists (NMR, neutrons, X-rays).

While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol.

This phenomenon, resulting from the balance between solid-liquid and liquid-liquid interactions, could benefit the development of microporous membranes for separating water-alcohol mixtures.We used molecular dynamics simulations of water-ethanol mixtures near planar organosilica surfaces, focussing on the role of surface properties in interfacial ethanol enrichment. Surface hydrophobicity was controlled by adjusting the ratio of methyl to hydroxyl groups. We analyzed the impact of surface composition, roughness, and the spatial distribution of functional groups on ethanol adsorption.Our simulations reveal that ethanol preferentially adsorbs onto hydrophobic organosilica surfaces functionalized with methyl groups, similar to previous findings for graphite. Ethanol enrichment is strongly influenced by mixture composition and surface properties, including roughness and functional group distribution. Hydrophobic surfaces consistently exhibit enhanced ethanol affinity, whereas hydroxylated surfaces show weaker adsorption.These findings demonstrate the ability of organosilica materials to preferentially adsorb ethanol over water.

In this paper, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and continuum boundary integral simulations to demonstrate that the time-averaged ‘S’ shape adopted by a flexible graphene nanosheet subject to moderate thermal fluctuation is almost identical to the shape predicted for negligible thermal fluctuations.

Here, we investigate the effects of minor water content on two representative SPEs through molecular dynamics simulations. Focusing on SPEs composed of different base polymers, namely, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and the same salt, lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), our simulations reveal that slight hydration facilitates an increase in ionic conductivity while preserving the mechanical integrity of the SPEs.

Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface.

However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we combined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high P'eclet numbers (Pe ). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio . We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and promotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous dissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds for both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the molecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in the dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of pure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes significant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These findings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene suspension due only to hydrodynamic effects.

As a consequence, the evolution of life on Earth is but a long sequence of cell divisions; wherever this sequence is broken, life ends. Cell division is not only how organisms perpetuate themselves, it is also one way in which complexity is built during development. The contribution of cell division to development is particularly striking in plants because plant cells are surrounded by stiff walls, making them clearly distinguishable from each other and fixing their spatial relation by preventing cell migration. As a result, many of the first microscopic observations ever published are of regularly organized cells within plant tissues. Based on these observations, many theories were put forward to explain how plant cells select their axis of division. The most perennial cell-division theory emerged from the work of Sachs (2), Berthold (3 …","tags":null,"title":"Forces behind plant cell division","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"286fd04fd27f44ea1011a6316d3ae7f8","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2016_gravelle_hal_nanofluidics_a_pedagogical.html","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2016_gravelle_hal_nanofluidics_a_pedagogical.html","section":"publications","summary":"Nanofluidics is the study of fluids confined in structures of nanometric dimensions (typically 1−100 nm).

The first chapter is an introduction to nanofluidics, containing a review of characteristic lengths, forces, or phenomena existing at the nanoscale. The second chapter is a study of the impact of geometry on the hydrodynamic permeability of a nanopore. This study, inspired by the shape of aquaporins, suggests a possible optimisation of permeability for bi-conical channels. The third chapter is a study of capillary filing inside subnanometric carbon channels which highlights the importance of the disjoining pressure induced by the fluid structuring inside the nanochannel. The fourth chapter is a study of nanofluidic diode, a component known to mimic the behaviour of semiconductor diode. The study highlights a strong coupling between water and ion dynamics which leads to a water flow rectification inside the diode. The fifth and last chapter is a study of the origin of commonly observed pink noise (1=f) in ionic current measurements through nanopores","tags":null,"title":"Nanofluidics: a theoretical and numerical investigation of fluid transport in nanochannels","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Laurent Joly","François Detcheverry","Christophe Ybert","Cécile Cottin-Bizonne","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"8a1cb259533ff1c542a37fa5d4a37575","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2015_31_2_gravelle_med_sci_permeabilite_optimale_des.html","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2015_31_2_gravelle_med_sci_permeabilite_optimale_des.html","section":"publications","summary":"Les aquaporines sont des protéines transmembranaires omniprésentes dans le corps humain.

This entrance effect can hinder the whole transport in certain situations, for short pores and/or highly slipping channels. In this paper, we explore the hydrodynamic permeability of hourglass shape nanopores using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the central pore size ranging from several nanometers down to a few Angströms. Surprisingly, we find a very good agreement between MD results and continuum hydrodynamic predictions, even for the smallest systems undergoing single file transport of water. An optimum of permeability is found for an opening angle around 5, in agreement with continuum predictions, yielding a permeability five times larger than for a straight nanotube. Moreover, we find that the permeability of hourglass shape nanopores is …","tags":null,"title":"Large permeabilities of hourglass nanopores: From hydrodynamics to single file transport","type":"publications"},{"authors":["A Gadaleta","C Sempere","**Simon Gravelle**","Alessandro Siria","R Fulcrand","C Ybert","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"89a73f054f2a73ae8bbaf192cad100d0","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2014_26_1_gadaleta_physics_of_fluids_sub-additive_ionic_transport.html","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2014_26_1_gadaleta_physics_of_fluids_sub-additive_ionic_transport.html","section":"publications","summary":"Nanopores, either biological, solid-state, or ultrathin pierced graphene, are powerful tools which are central to many applications, from sensing of biological molecules to desalination and fabrication of ion selective membranes. However, the interpretation of transport through low aspect-ratio nanopores becomes particularly complex as 3D access effects outside the pores are expected to play a dominant role. Here, we report both experiments and theory showing that, in contrast to naïve expectations, long-range mutual interaction across an array of nanopores leads to a non-extensive, sub-linear scaling of the global conductance on the number of pores N. A scaling analysis demonstrates that the N-dependence of the conductance depends on the topology of the network. It scales like G∼ N/log N for a 1D line of pores, and like| | G∼ N for a 2D array, in agreement with experimental measurements.

While osmosis can be expressed in simple terms via the van ’t Hoff ideal gas formula for the osmotic pressure, it is a complex phenomenon taking its roots in the subtle interactions occurring at the scale of the membrane nanopores. Here we use new opportunities offered by nanofluidic systems to create an osmotic diode exhibiting asymmetric water flow under reversal of osmotic driving. We show that a surface charge asymmetry built on a nanochannel surface leads to nonlinear couplings between water flow and the ion dynamics, which are capable of water flow rectification. This phenomenon opens new opportunities for water purification and complex flow control in nanochannels.","tags":null,"title":"Nanofluidic osmotic diodes: Theory and molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Laurent Joly","François Detcheverry","Christophe Ybert","Cécile Cottin-Bizonne","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"15efbfa71f952a81d2bfe6bedf7f21a3","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2013_110_41_gravelle_proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences_optimizing_water_permeability.html","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2013_110_41_gravelle_proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences_optimizing_water_permeability.html","section":"publications","summary":"The ubiquitous aquaporin channels are able to conduct water across cell membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the overall channel permeability.

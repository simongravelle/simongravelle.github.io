Here, we use nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements to better understand the dynamic properties of water within two types of salt crusts: sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4 ). Our experimental results display a stronger dispersion of the relaxation time T1 with frequency for the case of sodium sulfate as compared to sodium chloride salt crusts. To gain insight into these results, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of salt solutions confined within slit nanopores made of either NaCl or Na2SO4 . We find a strong dependence of the value of the relaxation time T1 on pore size and salt concentration. Our simulations reveal the complex interplay between the adsorption of ions at the solid surface, the structure of water near the interface, and the dispersion of T1 at low frequency, which we attribute to adsorption-desorption events.","tags":null,"title":"NMR Investigation of Water in Salt Crusts: Insights from Experiments and Molecular Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","David Beyer","Mariano Brito","Alexander Schlaich","Christian Holm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671667200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671667200,"objectID":"02a104438e830edb04b38e7b907bf1d1","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2023-reconsruction-of-nmr.html","publishdate":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-reconsruction-of-nmr.html","section":"publication","summary":"NMR relaxometry is a powerful and well established experimental approach to characterize dynamic processes in soft matter systems. All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited in time and length-scales that hinder modeling of systems like long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse-graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of loosing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by systematic characterization of R1 while performing systematic measurements on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations, but with a systematic offset. We find this offset to be due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intra-monomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers. We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details from the CG trajectories.","tags":null,"title":"Reconstruction of NMR Relaxation Rates from Coarse-Grained Polymer Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Christian Holm","Alexander Schlaich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652832e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652832e3,"objectID":"0ecde76220f0f90c68bb050ebbd36251","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2022-transport-of-thin.html","publishdate":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-transport-of-thin.html","section":"publication","summary":"Under ambient atmospheric conditions, a thin film of water wets many solid surfaces, including insulators, ice, and salt. The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.","tags":null,"title":"Transport of thin water films: from thermally activated random walks to hydrodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adyant Agrawal","**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"d0401451a881c79dfebceae8fe530191","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2022-viscous-peeling.html","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-viscous-peeling.html","section":"publication","summary":"Combining molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum simulations, we study the dynamics of propagation of a peeling front in a system composed of multilayered graphene nanosheets completely immersed in water. Peeling is induced by lifting one of the nanosheet edges with an assigned pulling velocity normal to the flat substrate. Using MD, we compute the pulling force as a function of the pulling velocity, and quantify the viscous resistance to the advancement of the peeling front. We compare the MD results to a 1D continuum model of a sheet loaded with modelled hydrodynamic loads. Our results show that the viscous dependence of the force on the velocity is negligible below a threshold velocity. Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance. Surprisingly, the shape of the sheet was found to be approximately independent of the pulling velocity even for the largest velocities considered.","tags":null,"title":"Viscous peeling of a nanosheet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jack Ratcliffe","**Nick Ballou**","Laurissa Tokarchuk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639008e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639008e3,"objectID":"0d0400674d84f312bdc0c2ab5c26ea85","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html","publishdate":"2021-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html","section":"example","summary":"Modern immersive virtual reality (IVR) often uses embodied con- trollers for interacting with virtual objects.

This distinction is important, as literature has shown that in the physical world, action-enabled and gesture-enabled learning produce distinct cognitive outcomes. This study attempts to understand whether sensorimotor-embodied interactions with objects in IVR can cognitively be considered as actions or gestures. It does this by comparing verb-learning outcomes between two conditions: (1) where participants move the controllers without touching virtual objects (gesture condition); and (2) where partici- pants move the controllers and manipulate virtual objects (action condition). We found that (1) users can have cognitively distinct outcomes in IVR based on whether the interactions are actions or gestures, with actions providing stronger memorisation outcomes; and (2) embodied controller actions in IVR behave more similarly to physical world actions in terms of verb memorization benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Actions, not gestures: contextualising embodied controller interactions in immersive virtual reality","type":"example"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"8f6b6171f008721eb519c38848d281cd","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2021-adsorption-of-single.html","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-adsorption-of-single.html","section":"publication","summary":"The adsorption of graphene-oxide (GO) nanoparticles at the interface between water and vapor was analyzed using all-atom molecular simulations for single and multiple particles.

Our results also show that the surface activity of the particle depends on the number of surface oxygen groups as well as on their distribution: for a given number of oxygen groups, a GO particle with a patched surface was found to be more surface active than a particle with evenly distributed groups. Then, to understand what sets the thickness of GO layers at interfaces, the adsorption energy of a test GO particle was measured in the presence of multiple GO particles already adsorbed at the interface.

To test its dimensionality and discriminant validity, we conducted an online survey (n = 467) asking people to report on effectance and related experiences in a recent play session. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses show poor fit with a unidimensional factor structure and poor discriminant validity with common enjoyment and mastery/competence measures, likely due to reverse-coded items and a separable input lag factor.

Our model is based on coupling the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with a boundary integral method to solve the hydrodynamic stress at the particle surface. Emphasis is placed on resolving accurately the stress distribution at the edges of the particle.

However, a stable orientation is possible if the surface of the platelet displays a hydrodynamic slip length λ comparable to or larger than the thickness of the platelet. In this article, by solving the Fokker–Plank equation for the orientation distribution function and corroborating the analysis with boundary integral simulations, we quantify a threshold Péclet number, Pec, above which such alignment occurs. We found that for Pe smaller than Pec, but larger than a second threshold, a regime emerges where Brownian fluctuations are strong enough to break the platelet's alignment and induce rotations, but with a period of rotation that depends on the value of λ. For Pe below this second threshold, slip has a negligible effect on the orientational dynamics. We use these thresholds to classify the dynamics of graphene-like nanoplatelets for realistic values of λ and apply our results to the quantification of the orientational contribution to the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of nanoplatelets with slip. We find a non-monotonic variation of this term, with a minimum occurring when the slip length is comparable to the thickness of the particle.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of hydrodynamic slip on the rotational dynamics of a thin Brownian platelet in shear flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616716800,"objectID":"c9b43379e5a74a23273e30f0fd14b978","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2021-violations-of-jeffery.html","publishdate":"2021-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-violations-of-jeffery.html","section":"publication","summary":"Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the shear-induced rotational dynamics of a Brownian nanographene (hexabenzocoronene) freely suspended in a liquid.

Results are extracted for different Péclet numbers and compared to the predictions by a theory developed for a rigid axisymmetric particle with orientation confined to the flow-gradient plane. The theory is based on the resolution of a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation for the angle φ made by one of the particle's diameters with the flow direction.

In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, and salience. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided.

In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood, and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed ﬁve unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was –0.40 (min: –0.54, max: –0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being (i.e. have similar concurrent validity). However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly gametime accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of functional and well-being outcomes, and work to identify a maximally parsimonious of dysregulated gaming criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority.","tags":null,"title":"The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming: A specification curve analysis of five gaming disorder scales","type":"example"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","**Nick Ballou**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588809600,"objectID":"5b78e5980d4842d046513dbcad4068c0","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.322112Z","relpermalink":"/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","section":"example","summary":"It is now common practice for video game companies to not just sell copies of games themselves, but to also sell in-game bonuses or items for a small real-world fee.

Such a stable orientation is in contradiction with the rotational motion predicted by classical colloidal hydrodynamics. This surprising effect is due to hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface and occurs when the slip length is larger than the platelet thickness; a slip length of a few nanometers may be sufficient to observe alignment. The predictions we developed by examining pure and surface-modified graphene is applicable to different solvent/2D material combinations. The emergence of a fixed orientation in a direction nearly parallel to the flow implies a slip-dependent change in several macroscopic transport properties, with potential impact on applications ranging from functional inks to nanocomposites.","tags":null,"title":"Hydrodynamic slip can align thin nanoplatelets in shear flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583712e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583712e3,"objectID":"b50bc032d4d61cb2ce09c926836ba105","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publication/2020-liquid-exfoliation.html","publishdate":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-liquid-exfoliation.html","section":"publication","summary":"Liquid-phase exfoliation, the use of a sheared liquid to delaminate graphite into few-layer graphene, is a promising technique for the large-scale production of graphene.

The scaling regime of the power spectrum extends down to a cutoff frequency which is far smaller than simple diffusion estimates.

Consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning, and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of Earth over geologic time. Here we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations, supported by synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy to study the molecular-scale interfacial processes that influence surface complexation in ferrihydrite-water systems contain- ing aqueous MoO42−. We validate the utility of this approach by calculating surface complexation models directly from simulations. The reactive force-field captures the realistic dynamics of surface restructuring, surface charge equilibration, and the evolution of the interfacial water hydrogen bond network in response to adsorption and pro- ton transfer. We find that upon hydration and adsorption, ferrihydrite restructures into a more disordered phase through surface charge equilibration, as revealed by simulations and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. We observed how this restructuring leads to a different interfacial hydrogen bond network compared to bulk water by monitoring water dynamics. Using umbrella sampling, we constructed the free energy landscape of aqueous MoO42− adsorp- tion at various concentrations and the deprotonation of the ferrihydrite surface. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with the values reported by experimental surface complexation models. These findings are important as reactive molecular dynamics opens new avenues to study mineral-water interfaces, enriching and refining surface complexation models beyond their foundational assumptions.","tags":null,"title":"Probing atomic-scale processes at the ferrihydrite-water interface with reactive molecular dynamics","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Learn Molecular Simulations with Python is designed as a step-by-step guide to developing simple Python code that includes the basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) represent a special class with rigid ring-shaped molecules forming interconnected voids of 0.2 to 2 nanometers. PIMs have high specific surface areas and are scalable, making them ideal for gas adsorption and mixture separation. However, only a few fluid mixtures can currently be separated using nanoporous materials, with most methods still relying on costly thermal processes such as distillation. Developing new nanopore-based separation processes could address environmental issues such as water contamination and CO2 emissions. To facilitate the emergence of these new processes, a better understanding of the complex behaviors of nanoconfined fluid mixtures is crucial. Achieving this goal requires novel multiscale approaches to connect the molecular details of confined molecules at the nanoscale to macroscopic transport properties.

The offer has now expired, and the selection process has moved to the next step.\nScope. With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate.

All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited to time and length-scales that hinder modeling of systems like long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse-graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of loosing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1 while performing systematic measurements on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations, but with a systematic offset. This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intra-monomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers. We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details for the CG trajectories.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the validity of NMR relaxation rates obtained from coarse-grained simulations of PEG-water mixtures","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Ángel Díaz Carral","Xiang Xu","**Simon Gravelle**","Azade Yazdan Yar","Siegfried Schmauder","Maria Fyta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686700800,"objectID":"0b100909a83f23c8b223bb5e2a79b967","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2023_306_carral_materials_chemistry_and_physics.html","publishdate":"2023-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2023_306_carral_materials_chemistry_and_physics.html","section":"publications","summary":"Binary complexes that can be found in copper alloys are investigated in this work through a combination of computer simulations and machine learning. Copper alloys are made of a copper matrix and a combination of single alloying elements in n-ary forms.  Due to the coexistence of different types of phases in this matrix, complex regions exist for which information on their precise atomistic structure is missing. In order to uncover such information, we apply active learning  and generate moment tensor potentials. This development is based on quantum-mechanical calculations. This approach allows the on-the-fly relaxation of many thousands of potentially novel candidates and check their stability. The ground-state energy of these structures is used to build active learning-generated convex hulls, which are in turn being compared to those from the simulations and the AFLOW database. This procedure provides an insight to additional new stable copper alloy relevant binary complexes. Here, in view of  Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, the  binary complexes Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Si, Cr-Ni, Cu-Ni, and Cu-Cr have been investigated. Their stability and the identification of novel stable candidates are discussed based on energetic arguments and the analysis of the respective phonon dispersion. The pipeline followed in this work is able to successfully predict binary phases in Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, specifically for the Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Ni and Cu-Ni complexes, and to extend the already reported structures in the AFLOW library. In the end, we show the applicability of a predicted Cu-Si stable phase and the developed machine learned potentials at the larger scale of atomistic simulations for the calculation of their mechanical properties and melting behavior.

Our experimental results display a stronger dispersion of the relaxation time T1 with frequency for the case of Na2SO4 as compared to NaCl salt crusts. To gain insight into these results, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of salt solutions confined within slit nanopores made of either NaCl or Na2SO4 . We find a strong dependence of the value of the relaxation time T1 on pore size and salt concentration.

The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation.

Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance.

We found that for Pe smaller than Pec, but larger than a second threshold, a regime emerges where Brownian fluctuations are strong enough to break the platelet's alignment and induce rotations, but with a period of rotation that depends on the value of λ. For Pe below this second threshold, slip has a negligible effect on the orientational dynamics. We use these thresholds to classify the dynamics of graphene-like nanoplatelets for realistic values of λ and apply our results to the quantification of the orientational contribution to the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of nanoplatelets with slip.

Surprisingly, we find a very good agreement between MD results and continuum hydrodynamic predictions, even for the smallest systems undergoing single file transport of water. An optimum of permeability is found for an opening angle around 5°, in agreement with continuum predictions, yielding a permeability five times larger than for a straight nanotube. Moreover, we find that the permeability of hourglass shape nanopores is even larger than single nanopores pierced in a molecular thin graphene sheet. This suggests that designing the geometry of nanopores may help considerably increasing the macroscopic permeability of membranes.","tags":null,"title":"Large permeabilities of hourglass nanopores: From hydrodynamics to single file transport","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Alessandro Gadaleta","Catherine Sempere","**Simon Gravelle**","Alessandro Siria","Rémy Fulcrand","Christophe Ybert","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391126400,"objectID":"8181d52727a7a5078430c8b2cf6e513b","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2014_26_1_gadaleta_physics_of_fluids.html","publishdate":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2014_26_1_gadaleta_physics_of_fluids.html","section":"publications","summary":"Nanopores, either biological, solid-state, or ultrathin pierced graphene, are powerful tools which are central to many applications, from sensing of biological molecules to desalination and fabrication of ion selective membranes. However, the interpretation of transport through low aspect-ratio nanopores becomes particularly complex as 3D access effects outside the pores are expected to play a dominant role. Here, we report both experiments and theory showing that, in contrast to naïve expectations, long-range mutual interaction across an array of nanopores leads to a non-extensive, sub-linear scaling of the global conductance on the number of pores N. A scaling analysis demonstrates that the N-dependence of the conductance depends on the topology of the network. It scales like G ∼ N/log N for a 1D line of pores, and like G∼N−−√ for a 2D array, in agreement with experimental measurements. Our results can be extended to alternative transport phenomena obeying Laplace equations, such as diffusive, thermal, or hydrodynamic transport. Consequences of this counter-intuitive behavior are discussed in the context of transport across thin membranes, with applications in energy harvesting.","tags":null,"title":"Sub-additive ionic transport across arrays of solid-state nanopores","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Clara Picallo","**Simon Gravelle**","Laurent Joly","Elisabeth Charlaix","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":138672e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":138672e4,"objectID":"61f1087828e7ce96d6ffe5567707b713","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2013_111_24_picallo_physical_review_letters.html","publishdate":"2013-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2013_111_24_picallo_physical_review_letters.html","section":"publications","summary":"Osmosis describes the flow of water across semipermeable membranes powered by the chemical free energy extracted from salinity gradients. While osmosis can be expressed in simple terms via the van ’t Hoff ideal gas formula for the osmotic pressure, it is a complex phenomenon taking its roots in the subtle interactions occurring at the scale of the membrane nanopores. Here we use new opportunities offered by nanofluidic systems to create an osmotic diode exhibiting asymmetric water flow under reversal of osmotic driving. We show that a surface charge asymmetry built on a nanochannel surface leads to nonlinear couplings between water flow and the ion dynamics, which are capable of water flow rectification. This phenomenon opens new opportunities for water purification and complex flow control in nanochannels.","tags":null,"title":"Nanofluidic osmotic diodes: Theory and molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Laurent Joly","François Detcheverry","Christophe Ybert","Cécile Cottin-Bizonne","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380067200,"objectID":"a237188a630d2de022768d2676b37b00","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2013_110_41_gravelle_proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences.html","publishdate":"2013-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2013_110_41_gravelle_proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences.html","section":"publications","summary":"Aquaporin channels are able to selectively conduct water across cell membranes, with remarkable efficiency. Although molecular details are crucial to the pore performance, permeability is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation at the entrances. Could the hourglass shape of aquaporins optimize such entrance effects? We show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the channel permeability. Strikingly, the optimal opening angles compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins, suggesting that their hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeability. This work also provides guidelines to optimize the performances of artificial nanopores, with applications in desalination, ultrafiltration, or energy conversion.","tags":null,"title":"Optimizing water permeability through the hourglass shape of aquaporins","type":"publications"}]

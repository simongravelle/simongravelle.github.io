The [version 2.0](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/) of LAMMPS tutorial has just been published, and offers:
* a new structure with a sphinx template
* tutorials are now written in rst format, instead of html, which should facilitate future collaborations
* a gorgeous dark mode (for the tutorials, not yet for the index page)

The [version 1.0](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/lammpstutorials-version1.0/) is still visible here, but is not maintained and some commands are likely to be obsolete.

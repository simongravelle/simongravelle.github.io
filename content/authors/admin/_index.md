**About me**

I am a physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces at the [LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble (France). I just received the [MSCA](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) grant *NanoSep* to study the demixing of fluid mixtures by hybrid nanoporous materials.

**Open source and open data**

**About me**

I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher at
[LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble, France. I use
molecular simulations to study fluids at interfaces and soft matter systems.

**Open Source and Outreach Activities**

I share all the code developed as part of my research as open source. You can
find it in my [GitHub](https://github.com/simongravelle/) repository. 
Additionally, see the following resources:

- [MAICoS](https://maicos-devel.gitlab.io/maicos/index.html), a Python toolkit 
  for analyzing confined molecular simulations
- [LAMMPS Tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io), tutorials for 
  beginners using LAMMPS
- [GROMACS Tutorials](https://gromacstutorials.github.io), tutorials for 
  beginners using GROMACS
- [MDCourse](https://mdcourse.github.io), a Python course 
  on molecular simulations
- [Gallery of Animations](https://www.youtube.com/@SimonGravelle) and 
  [Molecular Art](https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/), high-resolution 
  renderings of molecules

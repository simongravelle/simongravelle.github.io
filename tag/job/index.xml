&lt;p>Polymers are versatile, durable, and cost-effective materials essential in packaging, construction, and electronics. Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) represent a special class with rigid ring-shaped molecules forming interconnected voids of 0.2 to 2 nanometers. PIMs have high specific surface areas and are scalable, making them ideal for gas adsorption and mixture separation. However, only a few fluid mixtures can currently be separated using nanoporous materials, with most methods still relying on costly thermal processes such as distillation. Developing new nanopore-based separation processes could address environmental issues such as water contamination and CO2 emissions. To facilitate the emergence of these new processes, a better understanding of the complex behaviors of nanoconfined fluid mixtures is crucial. Achieving this goal requires novel multiscale approaches to connect the molecular details of confined molecules at the nanoscale to macroscopic transport properties. The aim of this postdoctoral position is to correlate the molecular properties of fluid mixtures in a microporous polymer with its large-scale permeability and selectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activities&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Development of realistic models of mixtures in microporous polymers using molecular simulations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Characterization of the structural and dynamic properties of confined fluids and their interactions with polymer surfaces.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upscaling of molecular results to the macroscopic scale using a lattice-based approach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Utilization of the lattice model to predict the macroscopic permeability and selectivity of PIM membranes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Skills&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The postdoctoral candidate must hold a PhD in physics, statistical mechanics, physical chemistry, or materials science, and have some experience in scientific programming and molecular simulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Work Context&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LIPhy is an interdisciplinary physics laboratory that brings together experts in the theory and experimentation of soft matter systems and fluids at interfaces. Located in Grenoble, LIPhy is surrounded by physics, chemistry, and biology laboratories, offering potential collaboration opportunities with experimental groups (SAXS, SANS, etc.) based on the candidate&amp;rsquo;s interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The position is located in a sector under the protection of scientific and technical potential (PPST), and therefore requires, in accordance with the regulations, that your arrival is authorized by the competent authority of the MESR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Starting date&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>February 2025, or after.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Apply.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Candicates can apply from the &lt;a href="https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Offres/CDD/UMR5588-SIMGRA-001/Default.aspx?lang=EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNRS website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PhD Position Available in LIPhy (Filled)</title><link>https://simongravelle.github.io/news/2023-phd-offer.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simongravelle.github.io/news/2023-phd-offer.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update.&lt;/strong> The offer has now expired, and the selection process has moved to the next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scope.&lt;/strong> With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue
gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous
sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well
documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF
angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales
of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (&amp;gt; 50 nm)
and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and
try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale
approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin
et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic
and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect,
we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing
a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a
bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase
separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice
model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the
change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure
Swing Adsorption), will be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Potential candidate.&lt;/strong> The PhD candidate should have a background in physics, physical
chemistry/chemical physics or materials science. He/she should also have some experience in scientific
programming and a background in statistical mechanics (including if possible Monte Carlo or/and
Molecular Dynamics).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Practical aspects.&lt;/strong> The position is available starting January 2024 and lasts for 36 months. The PhD student
will work under the supervision of Benoit Coasne/Simon Gravelle (LIPhy, Grenoble) and Yann Magnin
(CSTJF, Pau). He/she will be located at LIPhy in Grenoble, France but several short stays in CSTJF in
Pau, France will be planned. Applicants should provide a CV, a letter of motivation and the names and
email addresses of 2 or 3 references to:&lt;/p>
